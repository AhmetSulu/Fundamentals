# Basic C# Applications Collection

This project is a collection of basic C# applications, featuring three different programs:

1. **Random Number Guessing Game:** The user is given a random number and attempts to guess it.
2. **Calculator:** The user inputs two numbers and performs basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. **Average Grade Calculator:** The user enters three exam scores, and the program calculates the average and determines the corresponding letter grade.

## Requirements

- .NET Core 3.1 or later
- An IDE that supports C# (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

## Usage

### Random Number Guessing Game
When the program starts, the user is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. The user has 5 attempts to guess the correct number. The program informs the user if the guesses are correct or not.

### Calculator
The user inputs two numbers and selects the desired mathematical operation. The program performs the selected operation and displays the result.

### Average Grade Calculator
The program asks the user to input three exam scores. It then calculates the average and prints it along with the corresponding letter grade.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C#

## Structures and Functions Used

- **Loops:** `while`, `switch-case`
- **Conditional Statements:** `if-else`
- **User Input:** `Console.ReadLine()`
- **Input Validation:** `int.TryParse()`, `double.TryParse()`
- **Random Number Generation:** `Random.Next()`
- **Mathematical Operations:** Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)
